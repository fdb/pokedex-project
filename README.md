to complete this project:
* clone the repo
* `npm install`
* write the bodies of the 7 functions:
    * the `file-name.spec.js` files contain mocha/assert tests for the corresponding functions
    * you can also test your functions by calling them through the API in the main `index.js` file

To use the API (after cloning and installing):
* `node index.js`
* open Postman or a similar app
* go to `localhost:xxxx/` for API documentation
